/*
 * drop_dect_svc.c — headless background-service entry point.
 *
 * This is the "drop-in for custom firmware" variant: no GUI, no view dispatcher.
 * It loads the model once at boot and then runs the shared monitor loop forever,
 * sounding the siren whenever a drop is detected — even with no app open.
 *
 * Because stock firmware unloads FAPs on exit, a true always-on service must be
 * compiled into a firmware image (apptype=FlipperAppType.SERVICE). See README.md
 * for the manifest block and integration steps. The detection logic itself is
 * identical to the FAP — both call monitor_run().
